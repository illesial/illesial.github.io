My name is Osman Chaudhary and I'm an Applied Mathematician. I got my PhD in Mathematics at Boston University in 2017 under [Clarence Eugene Wayne](http://math.bu.edu/people/cew). My fields of research in mathematics are Dynamical Systems and Partial Differential Equations. I have a particular interest in using invariant manifold theory to reduce the dimension of models representing real-world phenomena in fluid mechanics and mathematical biology. You can read about some of my work back over on my [blog](https://illesial.github.io).
