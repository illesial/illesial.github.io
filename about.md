My name is Osman Chaudhary and I'm an Applied Mathematician and Data Scientist. I got my PhD in Mathematics at Boston University in 2017 under [Clarence Eugene Wayne](http://math.bu.edu/people/cew). My field of research in mathematics is Dynamical Systems and their applications to (fluid mechanics)[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00205-019-01440-2] and (mathematical biology)[https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsif.2013.0087]. 

Nowadays I do most of my coding in Python (for Data Science projects) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/), both for Mathematics, and increasingly for Differentiable Programming and Deep Learning uses as well. You can read about some of my work back over on my [blog](https://illesial.github.io), or check out my [Google Scholar Page.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kN8ngg8AAAAJ&hl=en)
